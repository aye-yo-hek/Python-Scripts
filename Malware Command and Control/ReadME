This repository contains two Python scripts that serve different purposes. Below is a brief explanation of each script:

1. Reverse Shell Payload (reverse_shell_payload.py)
Purpose: This script is designed to create a reverse shell payload on the victim's computer. It establishes a connection to the attacker's machine and listens for commands. When a command is received, it executes the command on the victim's system and sends back the command output to the attacker.

Usage:

Modify the connectBackIP and connectBackPort variables in the script to specify the attacker's IP address and port.
Run the script on the victim's computer.
Note: This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use is illegal.

2. Attacker's Server Script (attacker_server.py)
Purpose: This script acts as the server component for communication with the reverse shell payload. It listens for incoming connections from victims, sends commands to victims, receives and displays the command output from victims, and allows the attacker to interact with the victim's machine.

Usage:

Modify the attackerIP and attackerPort variables in the script to specify the attacker's IP address and port.
Run the script on the attacker's computer.
Note: This script is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use is illegal.
